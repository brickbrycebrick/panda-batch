    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing large volumes of text with Large Language Models (LLMs) can be slow and inefficient if not handled correctly. This post introduces the `BatchProcessor`, a powerful utility designed to streamline this process. It leverages asynchronous requests, parallel processing, and intelligent rate-limiting to efficiently process lists of texts or entire Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature is its integration with Pydantic, which allows you to define a structured output format for the LLM. This ensures that the model's responses are automatically validated and parsed into clean, type-safe Python objects, which is essential for building reliable data extraction pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BatchProcessor` is built upon two other key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `llm_config.py`: Manages LLM API configurations, making it easy to switch between different models and providers (like Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.).\n",
    "-   `rate_limiters.py`: Handles the complexities of API rate limiting to prevent errors and maximize throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in and see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's import the necessary libraries and initialize the `BatchProcessor`."

    "\n",
    "When you initialize the `BatchProcessor`, you can also control its rate-limiting behavior. This is crucial for managing API costs and staying within the limits of your LLM provider. It has the following arguments:\n",
    "-   `max_tokens_per_minute`: Sets the overall throughput limit for the processor.\n",
    "-   `safety_margin`: A buffer to prevent exceeding the rate limit due to slight variations in token counting. A value of `0.9` means the processor will target 90% of the specified limit.\n",
    "-   `max_concurrent`: Controls the number of asynchronous requests that can be active at any given time. Increasing this can improve speed, but may lead to rate-limiting errors if set too high."
